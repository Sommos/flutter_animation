## Purpose of the Program

This program is designed to test the flutter and dart Algorithms that initializes the principles of Flutter animation. In the repository you will be given a on-board view of my basic animation aimed to express these very concepts

This has been built into a web application accessible here: https://sommos.github.io/flutter_animation/

<br>
</br>

## What is Flutter and Dart

Flutter and Dart is a cross platform language using android Studio, that enables you to compile the program on an IOS or Android emulator, linking the possibility to add it in a web browser or as a desktop application for the following Operating systems such as (windows and linux).
